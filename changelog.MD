# TheQuartermaster — Changelog

📜 Changelog – Version 1.0.6  
  
🛠️ UI & Layout Changes  
  
Moved Information and Settings actions into the left sidebar navigation, styled consistently with existing section buttons.

Removed the floating bottom-right action buttons for a cleaner, unified navigation layout.

Removed large header panels across major sections to simplify the UI and reduce visual duplication.

Sidebar navigation now represents the primary interaction model for all sections and actions.

🎨 Visual Identity

Updated layout structure to further differentiate The Quartermaster’s UI from other Warband-related addons.

Improved spacing and content focus by eliminating redundant header elements.
