# TheQuartermaster — Changelog

📜 Changelog – Version 1.0.12  

🛠️ Fixes & Improvements  

- Enabled **Guild Bank (view-only)** on the **Items** screen (appears after Warband Bank when in a guild).
- Code rewrite in some areas, tiding up code, but is still Work in progress.
- Guild Bank data is cached **per guild** (shared across characters in the same guild).
- Default Guild Bank display mode is **Slot View**, matching the other bank tabs.
- Created a Dashboard as the first opening screen.  
- Moved Information and Settings actions into the left sidebar navigation, styled consistently with existing section buttons.  
- Removed the floating bottom-right action buttons for a cleaner, unified navigation layout.  
- Sidebar navigation now represents the primary interaction model for all sections and actions.  

🎨 Visual Identity  

Updated layout structure to further differentiate The Quartermaster’s UI from other Warband-related addons.  
Improved spacing and content focus by eliminating redundant header elements.  

### Notes
- Thank you to everyone who helped test the pre‑release builds ❤️
