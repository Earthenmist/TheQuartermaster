# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep these addons safe and reliable.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue, exploit, or abuse scenario, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report it privately using one of the following:

- Discord (preferred): https://discord.gg/U8mKfHpeeP  
  Please DM **LanniOfAlonsus** with details.
- GitHub: If private reporting is available, use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" option.

## What to include

Please include:

- Addon name and version
- WoW client (Retail / Midnight / Classic)
- Steps to reproduce
- Any relevant logs or screenshots

## Scope

This applies to:

- Exploits or abuse scenarios (spam, griefing, unintended automation)
- Data exposure issues (guild/officer notes, stored data)
- Packaging / release pipeline issues (e.g. leaked keys)

Thank you!
