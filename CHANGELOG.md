## 🧩 Addon Updates (2026-02-26)

**The Quartermaster** — v1.0.22  

**Changes:**  
- We’ve added a brand-new Recipes system to TheQuartermaster!

You can now track which of your characters know which profession recipes, making it much easier to answer questions like:

“Which of my Jewelcrafters can make this ring?”

“Who has the older expansion patterns?”

“Which alt can craft this decor item?”

🔹 How It Works

Enable Track Profession Recipes in settings.

Open a profession window on a character to automatically scan and cache their known recipes.

Visit the new Recipes tab in TheQuartermaster to:

Search by recipe name

See which characters can craft it

View item tooltips directly from the results

🔹 Design Notes

Only learned recipes are stored.

Data is stored efficiently to minimise SavedVariables growth.

Cooking is supported.

Fishing and Archaeology are intentionally ignored.

Includes per-character cache reset options.

This feature is opt-in and built to scale safely across multiple alts.

Enjoy being able to finally answer “who can make that?” without logging through every character! 
  
**Fixes:**  
- None

**Known issues:**  
- None currently known.
